# Mineral Targeting 2025

This project is a submission for the **IndiaAI Hackathon on Mineral Targeting 2025**, a collaboration between IndiaAI (under the Digital India Corporation, MeitY) and the Geological Survey of India (GSI). Developed by **Suraj Kumar Pandey** (Developer/Scientist/Student), the initiative leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to identify new potential areas for exploration of critical minerals (e.g., REE, Ni-PGE, Copper) and other commodities (e.g., Diamond, Iron, Manganese, Gold) within a 39,000 sq. km area in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, India.

## Project Overview
- **Theme**: Identification of concealed and deep-seated mineralized bodies with depth modeling, using AI/ML algorithms for data processing, modeling, validation, and generating mineral predictive maps.
- **Objective**: Enhance the effectiveness of critical mineral exploration by integrating multi-parametric geoscience data.
- **Live Demo**: [https://mineral-targeting-2025.onrender.com/](https://mineral-targeting-2025.onrender.com/)

## Features
- Predicts mineral concentrations (e.g., Copper, Iron, Gold) using advanced ML techniques.
- Generates visualizations including predictive maps, heatmaps, and high-potential zone indicators.
- Web-based interface with downloadable results and reports.
- Attractive welcome page with developer details and hackathon context.

## Technical Details
- The solution is deployed on a cloud platform, utilizing a custom-built web application.
- Incorporates preprocessed geoscience data and trained ML models for predictive analytics.
- Visualizations are dynamically generated and accessible via the live demo.

## Datasets
This project utilizes a curated selection of geoscience datasets provided by GSI through the AIKosh platform, including geological maps, geochemical data, geophysical data, and exploration reports. Specific datasets are processed and integrated to support the predictive modeling.
